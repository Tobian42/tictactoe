# Welcome to my small little TicTacToe game written in python!

## RUN THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK! as I have no Idea what I wrote


### What you will need:
pygame, numpy and ofc python3 (I used 3.12)
and you will need a friend to enjoy this game <sub>(you can buy some online I think)</sub>

### What you can tinker with:
If you wish to modify the scale of the window or the board size, you can easily do this in the config.json file.
This programm even includes a verification system (config.py) to check if all entered Values in the config.json file are valid and can be used by the index.py file

# FAQ

### I found a bug!
Congratulations! You can open a issue on the github (https://github.com/Tobian42/TicTacToe)

### Will there be future Updates?
Probably as I want to add a Single Player mode, Terminal mode and support for more than 2 players.
You can look at the config.json file to check when the last update was.
